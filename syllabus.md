# AI@Penn Bootcamp - Draft Syallbus
The idea behind each session is to provide a intuitive understanding of one or two Machine Learning model families, and then apply them on a sample dataset using
libraries such as Sklearn and Keras/Tensorflow.

### Session 1
* Brief intro to Machine Learning.
* Slightly more in-depth overview of Logistic Regression (than normal).
* Basics of numpy and pandas.
* Programming Session: Social media advertisment success prediction (classification).

### Session 2
* Overview of SVMs, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm.
* Overview of Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms.
* Introduce and apply data visualization concepts.
* Programming Session: Credit default prediction (classification).

### Session 3
* Overview of Linear Regression.
* Introduce and apply data preprocessing techniques.
* Programming Session: Real estate valuation (regression).

### Session 4
* Overview of standard Neural Networks.
* Introduce data normalization concepts (like Dropout).
* Programming Session: Predicting outreach/shares of news articles (regression).

### Session 5
* Overview of Long-Short Term Networks (LSTMs).
* Introduce time-series data.
* Introduce using APIs to get live data.
* Programming Session: Predicting stock prices using historical data (time series).

### Session 6
* Overview of Convolutional Neural Networks (LSTMs).
* Introduce web scraping.
* Programming Session: Differentiating between two types of objects, eg. Football vs Basketball - comparison choice is up to students (computer vision).
